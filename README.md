# API documentation portal

API documentation portal lets you effortlessly create and publish a customized site with API documentation, automatically generated from OpenAPI files. The drag-and-drop administrative interface allows for customizations without writing any code and the default GitHub-based workflow enables communication and collaboration between API providers and API consumers, automation with GitHub Actions, and free hosting with GitHub Pages. API documentation portal relies on the same technology as the Azure API Managementâ€™s developer portal ([documentation](https://aka.ms/apimdocs/portal), [GitHub](https://aka.ms/apimdevportal)), which is used by thousands of Azure customers.
